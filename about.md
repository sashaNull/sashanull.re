# About Me

Hi, I'm **Cuong Nguyen** - a Master’s student at University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), who spends way too much time breaking things that aren't mine (legally, of course) in the name of science. I'm currently a research apprentice at [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/), which is basically where people like me gather to make computers cry. I focus on kernel exploitation, binary exploitation, and reverse engineering.

When I’m not doing research, I compete in hacking competitions called [ctfs](https://ctftime.org/about/). I'm part of [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/), one of the most legendary ctf teams out there. Back in undergrad, I started the [VinUni Hacking Club](https://github.com/V1nUn1H4ck1ngClub), where I now serve as an advisor, training the next generation of talented hackers. 

My go-to challenges are usually pwn and rev, but when they're too hard, I'll pretend I like web or osint just to feel productive. I compete under the handle *sashaNull*.
